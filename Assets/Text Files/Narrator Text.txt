Hey? Why are you flying a mothership? [ENTER]
 
It doesn't matter, we have a xeno invasion force that's taken root in this sector, and for the mean time you're all we've got [ENTER]

YN:Do you at least know how to use that thing? (Y/N)

Y:T:(Activate player click)

Y:F:Okay, sounds good. Just take it out for a spin, crush the xenos, and we can talk later about where you got your hands on it. 

N:T:(Activate player click)

N:Well, it sure was a mighty fine plan to get your hands on a mothership you didn't know how to operate, now wasn't it?

N:No matter, I can teach you the basics. [ENTER]

N:T:Assuming you're looking through the deployed sattelite that follows your mothership, you can select a federation outpost with LEFT CLICK.

(when base is selected)

N:T:That's the way. Now, you don't have enough forces to overwhelm them directly, so you should probably take over that derilict base. [ENTER]

N:There might be a few security drones on the fritz, but it shouldn't be too hard to refurbish it into your own. [ENTER]


N:Just select the percentage of your base's troops that it'll take. You do know math, right? Don't even answer that one, just take the base already. [ENTER]


N:You can send an attack by pressing RIGHT CLICK on it when you have a base selected

(when the neutral base is taken over)

N:F:You're a natural, kid. Now, using everything you've learned, rush the final base.

(The final base is taken over)

(YOU WIN screen appears)

W:Good work, but I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to report that mothership as stolen property. [ENTER]

W:However,in order to get it into any friendly territory you're going to have to go through a wall of xenos. [ENTER]

W:Do me, and yourself, a favor, and help me clear them out. I might even be able to make you a deal for a light sentence. [ENTER]

L:I have no idea how you lost, they weren't even attacking. Go die somewhere peaceful
